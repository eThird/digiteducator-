    "overview": "After discussing the task with a senior engineer, you have received a few helpful parameters and conversions to get you started in your research. Additionally, they provided you with a template to help you gather more data to guide the decision-making process. These are all provided below.",
    "instructions": [
      "Use the 'Fuel Comparison Template' below.",
      "Add other energy sources and metrics as you see fit (use your engineering judgment to decide what is essential!).",
      "Use consistent units (SI or Imperial) for all of the metrics, and state your unit assumption when presenting the data.",
      "Take notes on various implications of the energy sources, such as infrastructure requirements, relative difficulty to manufacture, etc.",
      "Once you have compiled all the data for the various fuel/energy sources, decide which energy source you think should be selected for the next-generation propulsion system."
